# LHL-Final-Project
The project combines the tools, skills, and techniques seen throughout the course. I was given a realistic on-the-job scenario, from which I made security recommendations. I analyzed the threat scenario and created an incident response report. As a final step, I prepared a presentation to outline the key features of my recommendations and report.
